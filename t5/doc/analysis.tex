\subsection{OP AMP model}

In the theoretical part, we used the ideal model of the OP-AMP. So, we considered the input impedance equal to $\infty \Omega$, the ouput impedance
equal to $0 \Omega$, and the gain equal to $\infty$. As a consequence, the difference of voltage between the non inverting input $v_{+}$ and the
inverting input $v_{-}$ is equal to zero and we have a \textit{virtual ground} in the non inverting input.


\subsection{Frequency response}

In order to obtain the transfer function, we used nodal analysis to obtain the following system of equations:

\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{Z_{C1}} + \frac{1}{Z_{C2}} & -\frac{1}{Z_{C2}} \\
    -\frac{1}{Z_{C1}}                                   & -\frac{1}{R_2}    \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    V_{1} \\ V_{out}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{V_{in}}{R_1} \\ 0
  \end{bmatrix}
\]

\begin{equation}
  T(\omega) = \frac{\widetilde{V_{out}}}{\widetilde{V_{in}}}
  \label{frequencyR}
\end{equation}

We used Octave to solve this system of equations numerically for a range of frequencies of the input signal. The results will be shown in section \ref{sec:side}:
 in plot \ref{fig:argTOct}, in the left, we have the magnitude, calculated from $20*log_{10}(abs(T(j\omega)))$ as function of log(f). 
 In plot \ref{fig:output1}, in the left, we have the phase, obtained by taking the $arg(T(\omega))$, as function of log (f) in Hz.

\subsection{Input and Output Impedance and Central Frequency}

To evaluate the frequency of the input signal whose gain is maximized, we applied the \textit{max} function of Octave to the array in which
we have the values of the magnitude of the gain. The value we get is presented in the table \ref*{tab:TheoreticalResults}.

In order to calculate the input impedance of the circuit in the central frequency,
we used the following formula with the frequency of the input signal we got before:

\begin{equation}
  Z_{input} = \frac{V_{in}}{\frac{V_{in} - V_1}{R_1}} \frac{1}{1000} k \Omega
\end{equation}

Due to the teoretical model used for the OP-AMP, we have an $Z_{output} = 0$.
