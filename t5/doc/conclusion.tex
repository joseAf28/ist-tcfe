\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The ultimate goal of this laboratory assignment, to analyse
the given RC circuit theoretically and using simulation, has been achieved, 
since the simulation results matched the theoretical results with 
great accuracy. The currents and voltages obtained from  Ngspice
and Octave scripts are equal up to fifth decimal case.
With respect to the plots obtained with the Octave and NGspice, we 
have graphs that have the same behaviour and are equal.
These results were expected because we use the same linear models to
describe the behaviour of the components in \textit{Ngspice} and in
theoretical analysis.
