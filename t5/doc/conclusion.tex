%% dizer que nao atingimos 40 dB com componentes dados
The goal of designing a bandpass filter using the given components was achieved. We obtained the desired central frequency of about 1000Hz, however, to achieve this we could not obtain the desired gain
of 40 dB, having reached, at best, with the given components, about 18 dB. The cost of our design is (custo) and the merit is, therefore, (merito). We identified reasons of the differences
between some of the theoretical and simulation results, when they differed considerably. In general, though, the results were similar between both simulations.
