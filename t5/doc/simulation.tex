\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section, we used the indicated OP-AMP model to simulate 
the circuit in figure \ref{fig:circuit} using the software \textit{Ngspice}.


In this section we wrote a \textit{Ngspice} script to simulate the Band-Pass 
fiter circuit, using the OP-AMP model provided in the .net script.
Finally we measured the output voltage gain in the passband,
the central frequency, the maximum gain, and the input and output impedances.
