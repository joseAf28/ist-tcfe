\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

By creating a \textit{Ngspice} script, we started out by trying different configurations for the envelope detector. We ended up choosing to move on with a full-wave bridge rectifier. 
Then, we joined the envelope detector with a voltage regulator until we had satisfactory results. All of this looking at 10 periods after the initial transient period, and using the default diode model.
 Finally, we added \textit{Ngspice} commands to calculate the main quality outputs: the average and the ripple. The results will be shown later, side-by-side with the theoretical analysis' results.
