Operating point

\[
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    i = 0, if v < V_{ON}   \\
    v = V_{ON}, if  i \geq \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
\]

Due to the fact we have a full wave rectifier, we have two diodes in series either the voltage source be positive or negative.
Moreover, the output voltage of this bridge, $V_o$:

\[
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    V_o = 0,  if  |V_s| < 2V_{ON}               \\
    v = |V_s| - 2 V_{ON}, if |V_s| \geq 2V_{ON} \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
\] where $V_s$ is the voltage of the source

In order to smooth the signal of the output voltage, terminal V2 and V3, we add a capacitor and a resistor in parallel

So we have that initially the potential difference between the terminal of the capacitor is $V_o$. From the time instant $t_{OFF}$
the capacitor starts to discharge through the resistor because is voltage is bigger than $V_o$ at this point, which smooths the output voltage.
During this period, the diodes are inversely polarized and they do not enable to pass charge.


Incremental Analysis

So during this interval of time, we have:

\begin{equation}
  i_R = - i_C \Leftrightarrow \frac{v_s}{R} = -C\frac{dv_s}{dt} \Leftrightarrow \frac{A}{R}\cos(\omega t_{OFF}) = C A \omega \sin(\omega t_{OFF})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  t_{OFF} = \frac{1}{\omega}\arctan\frac{1}{\omega RC}
\end{equation}

So from $t \geq t_{OFF}$, we have:

\begin{equation}
  v_o(t) = A\cos(\omega t_{OFF}) e^{-\frac{t-t_{OFF}}{RC}}
\end{equation}

At $t = t_{ON}$, the diodes goes ON again:

\begin{equation}
  v_o(t_{ON}) = A\cos(\omega t_{OFF}) e^{-\frac{t_{ON}-t_{OFF}}{RC}}
\end{equation}

We solve this equation with \textit{Octave}.
