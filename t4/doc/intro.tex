% state the learning objective 
The purpose of this laboratory assignment is to develop a audio amplifier 
circuit, using a gain stage and a output stage. 
The following report is divided into three main sections.
We started with the theoretical study of the circuit, having analysed
the gain stage and the output stage separately using operating point and 
incremental analysis. Finally we studied the frequency response of the circuit.

Subsequently, we simulated the circuit and after producing satisfactory 
results we compared them to the theoretical results in the previous section.

These parts are described, respectively, in sections Analysis 
and Simulation.

Finally, the conclusions of this study are indicated in Conclusion.
