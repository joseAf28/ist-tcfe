\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The ultimate goal of this laboratory assignment, to analysed 
the given circuit theoretically and using simulation (and consequently
familiarising the group with the tools used), has been achieved, since
the simulation results matched the theoretical results with great accuracy. 


The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ. For more complex components, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this
work.
