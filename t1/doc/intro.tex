In this laboratory assignment we study the purely resistive circuit 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.

We started with the theoretical analysis of the circuit, 
firslty using bash analysis and secondly the nodal method. 
This procedure is explored in section ~\ref{sec:analysis};
We used the software Octave to solve the derived systems of equations.

Following this, we simulated the circuit using the software Ngspice. 
Subsequently we compared the results of the simulation with the theoretical
results. This is described in section ~\ref{sec:simulation}.

Finally, the conclusions of this study are indicated in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
