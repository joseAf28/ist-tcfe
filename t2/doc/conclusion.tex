\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The ultimate goal of this laboratory assignment, to analyse 
the given circuit theoretically and using simulation (and consequently
familiarising the group with the tools used), has been achieved, since
the simulation results matched the theoretical results with great accuracy. 
These results were expected because we use the same linear models to 
describe the behaviour of the components in \textit{Ngspice} and in 
theoretical analysis (\ref{sec:analysis}). Furthermore, none of
the components is time dependent.
