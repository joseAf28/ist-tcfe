\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section the circuit in figure \ref{fig:circuit} is simulated
using the software \textit{Ngspice}.

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

We started by simulating the static circuit for  $time (t) < 0$ and 
got the voltages and currents in each node and branch of the circuit.
Table~\ref{tab:op_tab} shows the simulated operating 
point results for the circuit under analysis.
Note that, because at $t<0$ the voltage is constant, the current through
the capacitor is zero, i.e., it can be replaced by an open circuit.

Following this we replaced $V_s$ with a short circuit and substituted
the capacitor with a voltage source $Vx = V_8-V_6$, $V_8$ and $V_6$
being the potencial at nodes 8 and 6 previously calculated.
From this we obtained the values in table **INSERIR TABELA AJUDA**.

\subsection{Transient Analysis}

In this section we analysed the response of the circuit for several
conditions.

We started with the natural response of the circuit, that is, 
with $V_s=0$, to a boundary condition ($V_6$ and $V_8$ as determined 
in the previous section).
Using ngspice's transient analysis we were able to simulate the response. 
The value of $V_6$ is plotted in \ref{} **INSERIR FIGURA**.

Afterwards, we simulated the total response of the full circuit (natural 
+ forced) by assuming $V_s = sin(\omega t)$ (as explained in figure \ref{fig:circuit}), 
for a frequency of 1kHz.
The voltage in node 6 ($V_6$) and the input voltage ($V_s$) are plotted 
in figure \ref{}

Finally, with the goal of observing the high-frequency ??filter?? nature 
of the capacitor, we simulated the circuit for various frequencies of 
$V_s$ (0.1Hz to 1MHz)
